 # Capacity of Parties: A Beginner's Guide

 **Introduction:**
 Contract law dictates that not everyone has the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. Certain classes of individuals are considered incapable of contracting, meaning their agreements may not be enforceable. This guide will explore who these individuals are and the implications for contracts they attempt to make.

 **1. Competency to Contract:**

 *   **Section 11 of the Contract Act:**  Defines a competent person as someone who:
  *   Is of the age of majority (18 in most jurisdictions).
  *   Is of sound mind.
  *   Is not disqualified from contracting by any law.
 *   **General Rule:** All parties to a contract *must* be competent.

 **2. Age of Majority:**

 *   **Definition:** A minor is someone who has *not* reached the age of 18.
 *   **Agreements with Minors:**  An agreement with a minor is generally *void* (not valid or legally binding).
  * Example: If a minor rents a car, the rental agreement is not enforceable against them.
 *   **Rectification:** A minor cannot ratify (confirm) an agreement upon reaching the age of majority.
 *   **Reimbursement:** If a minor fraudulently misrepresents their age to enter a contract, a court *may* order them to reimburse the other party for any consideration received.
   * Case Law: *Leslie Ltd. v. Sheill* (1914) - If a minor obtains property by misrepresenting their age, they can be compelled to restore it if it's traceable in their possession.

 **3. Necessaries Supplied to Incapable Persons (Section 68 of the Contract Act):**

 *   **Rule:** If someone incapable of contracting (e.g., a minor or a person of unsound mind) or someone they are legally bound to support is supplied with necessaries (items suitable to their condition in life), the supplier is entitled to be reimbursed from the *property* of the incapable person.
 *   **Example:** If someone provides necessities to a person of unsound mind, they can be reimbursed from that person's property.
 *  **Adult Surety for a Minor:** When an adult acts as a surety in the contract of guarantee for a minor, the adult is responsible to the third party whom the guarantee is given.
 *   **Minor and Insolvency:** A minor cannot be declared insolvent as he does not have the capacity to enter into a contract. If he is provided with necessities, the amount for such necessities can be recovered from his property only.
  * Example: If A provides food for a year to the minor B, A can claim the money for the food. If B has no property, A cannot recover the money from the minor.
 *  **Agreement with minor and adult:** if a minor and an adult enter into an agreement with another person. The adult is bound by the terms however the minor is not bound by the terms of the contract.

 **4. Soundness of Mind:**

 *   **Section 12:** A person is of sound mind if, at the time of making a contract, they can understand it and form a rational judgment about its effect on their interests.
 *   **Lucid Intervals:** A person of unsound mind who has periods of lucidity *can* contract during those intervals.
 *   **Intoxication/Delirium:** A person delirious from disease or involuntarily intoxicated to the point of not understanding the contract *cannot* contract.  Self-intoxication is generally not an excuse.
 *   **Burden of Proof:** The person claiming someone was of unsound mind has the burden of proving it.

 **5. Disqualification by Law:**

 *   **Diplomatic Agents:** Cannot be sued when acting on behalf of their sovereign.
 *   **Companies:** Cannot enter into agreements outside the powers granted in their memorandum of association.
 *   **Alien Enemies:** Contracts with alien enemies are not valid.
 *   **Convicts:** Convicts in prison cannot enter into agreements.

 **6. Void vs. Voidable Contracts:**

 | Feature           | Void                               | Voidable                                                                    |
 | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Validity          | Entirely invalid                   | Valid unless/until the disadvantaged party chooses to reject it                |
 | Enforceability    | Not legally enforceable            | Enforceable by the "injured" party; the other party can cancel               |
 | Example           | Contract with a minor (generally)  | Contract entered under duress                                             |
